# -AGA-BI-LSTM-StockPredictor
Stock Market Predictor Model built using BI LSTM with Integrated Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for Optimization using Python in JupyterNoteBook


In particular, I would like to stress that I did not place a high priority on improving prediction outcomes because my focus was instead on showing how to design and train an Integrated Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with  BI LSTM model. You are free to use this repository as a starting point for your own improvements to the art of stock prediction.
